# kNN-Relational

This repository contains software that corresponds to the papers: 

* Ahmed M. Aly, Walid G. Aref, Mourad Ouzzani: Cost Estimation of Spatial k-Nearest-Neighbor Operators. EDBT 2015: 457-468
* Ahmed M. Aly, Walid G. Aref, Mourad Ouzzani: Spatial queries with k-nearest-neighbor and relational predicates. SIGSPATIAL/GIS 2015: 28:1-28:10

The repository includes algorithms for processing queries with relational and kNN predicates (either kNN select or kNN join predicates). Also, the repository includes a cost model that can be used to arbitrate between the possible query execution plans for processing relational and kNN predicates.
